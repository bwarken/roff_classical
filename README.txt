This archive contains some of the classical papers of the roff
language.  The actual free roff version is groff (GNU roff) at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/groff>.

The files here are in a PDF format, which can be read by most actual
PDF viewers.  On the other hand, the original files in the internet
are mostly in an unreadable PS format.

The meaning of the files and their original positions can be found at
<http://troff.org/papers.html>.

There is also a good website with the BSD man-pages, going as far back
as RUNOFF: <http://manpages.bsd.lv/history.html>.
